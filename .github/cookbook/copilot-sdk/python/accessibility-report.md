# Generating Accessibility Reports

Build a CLI tool that analyzes web page accessibility using the Playwright MCP server and generates detailed WCAG-compliant reports with optional test generation.

> **Runnable example:** [recipe/accessibility_report.py](recipe/accessibility_report.py)
>
> ```bash
> cd recipe && pip install -r requirements.txt
> python accessibility_report.py
> ```

## Example scenario

You want to audit a website's accessibility compliance. This tool navigates to a URL using Playwright, captures an accessibility snapshot, and produces a structured report covering WCAG criteria like landmarks, heading hierarchy, focus management, and touch targets. It can also generate Playwright test files to automate future accessibility checks.

## Prerequisites

```bash
pip install github-copilot-sdk
```

You also need `npx` available (Node.js installed) for the Playwright MCP server.

## Usage

```bash
python accessibility_report.py
# Enter a URL when prompted
```

## Full example: accessibility_report.py

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import asyncio
from copilot import (
    CopilotClient,
    SessionConfig,
    MessageOptions,
    SessionEvent,
    PermissionHandler,
)

    print("=== Accessibility Report Generator ===\n")

    url = input("Enter URL to analyze: ").strip()

    if not url:
        print("No URL provided. Exiting.")
        return

    # Ensure URL has a scheme
    if not url.startswith("http://") and not url.startswith("https://"):
        url = "https://" + url

    print(f"\nAnalyzing: {url}")
    print("Please wait...\n")

    # Create Copilot client with Playwright MCP server
    client = CopilotClient()
    await client.start()

    session = await client.create_session(SessionConfig(
        model="claude-opus-4.6",
        streaming=True,

## How it works

1. **Playwright MCP server**: Configures a local MCP server running `@playwright/mcp` to provide browser automation tools
2. **Streaming output**: Uses `streaming=True` and `ASSISTANT_MESSAGE_DELTA` events for real-time token-by-token output
3. **Accessibility snapshot**: Playwright's `browser_snapshot` tool captures the full accessibility tree of the page
4. **Structured report**: The prompt engineers a consistent WCAG-aligned report format with emoji severity indicators
5. **Test generation**: Optionally detects the project language and generates Playwright accessibility tests

## Key concepts

### MCP server configuration

The recipe configures a local MCP server that runs alongside the session:

```python
session = await client.create_session(SessionConfig(
    mcp_servers={
        "playwright": {
            "type": "local",
            "command": "npx",
            "args": ["@playwright/mcp@latest"],
            "tools": ["*"],
        }
    },
        on_permission_request=PermissionHandler.approve_all))
```

This gives the model access to Playwright browser tools like `browser_navigate`, `browser_snapshot`, and `browser_click`.

### Streaming with events

Unlike `send_and_wait`, this recipe uses streaming for real-time output:

```python
def handle_event(event: SessionEvent):
    if event.type.value == "assistant.message_delta":
        print(event.data.delta_content or "", end="", flush=True)
    elif event.type.value == "session.idle":
        done.set()

session.on(handle_event)
```
