    Use the Playwright MCP server to analyze the accessibility of this webpage: {url}
    
    Please:
    1. Navigate to the URL using playwright-browser_navigate
    2. Take an accessibility snapshot using playwright-browser_snapshot
    3. Analyze the snapshot and provide a detailed accessibility report
    
    Format the report EXACTLY like this structure with emoji indicators:

    📊 Accessibility Report: [Page Title] (domain.com)

    ✅ What's Working Well
    | Category | Status | Details |
    |----------|--------|---------|
    | Language | ✅ Pass | lang="en-US" properly set |
    | Page Title | ✅ Pass | "[Title]" is descriptive |
    | Heading Hierarchy | ✅ Pass | Single H1, proper H2/H3 structure |
    | Images | ✅ Pass | All X images have alt text |
    | Viewport | ✅ Pass | Allows pinch-zoom (no user-scalable=no) |
    | Links | ✅ Pass | No ambiguous "click here" links |
    | Reduced Motion | ✅ Pass | Supports prefers-reduced-motion |
    | Autoplay Media | ✅ Pass | No autoplay audio/video |

    ⚠️ Issues Found
    | Severity | Issue | WCAG Criterion | Recommendation |
    |----------|-------|----------------|----------------|
    | 🔴 High | No <main> landmark | 1.3.1, 2.4.1 | Wrap main content in <main> element |
    | 🔴 High | No skip navigation link | 2.4.1 | Add "Skip to content" link at top |
    | 🟡 Medium | Focus outlines disabled | 2.4.7 | Default outline is none - ensure visible :focus styles exist |
    | 🟡 Medium | Small touch targets | 2.5.8 | Navigation links are 37px tall (below 44px minimum) |

    📋 Stats Summary
    - Total Links: X
    - Total Headings: X (1× H1, proper hierarchy)
    - Focusable Elements: X
    - Landmarks Found: banner ✅, navigation ✅, main ❌, footer ✅

    ⚙️ Priority Recommendations
    - Add <main> landmark - Wrap page content in <main role="main"> for screen reader navigation
    - Add skip link - Hidden link at start: <a href="#main-content" class="skip-link">Skip to content</a>
    - Increase touch targets - Add padding to nav links and tags to meet 44×44px minimum
    - Verify focus styles - Test keyboard navigation; add visible :focus or :focus-visible outlines

    Use ✅ for pass, 🔴 for high severity issues, 🟡 for medium severity, ❌ for missing items.
    Include actual findings from the page analysis - don't just copy the example.
